`./lang` contains the beginnings of the programming language. It's written in TypeScript and can run
basic programs (via compilation to JS). You can play with a barebones version on the web at
[otium.sh/lang-demo](https://otium.sh/lang-demo).

`./os` has the operating system kernel, running on qemu (riscv) or wasm (web/nodejs)

`./scratch` is one off experiments
