This is a simple implementation of a programming language in TypeScript with bun.

You can run individual components on a file to test them

> bun lexer.ts scratch.ot
> bun parser.ts scratch.ot

Tests

> bun test lexer.test.ts
> bun test parser.test.ts

Tests should be re-run after changing components
