a list of editor bugs encountered: 

11/3
- first line doesn't render
- 23rd line doesn't render
- scrolling down doesn't work right, requires two presses to do anything and renders the wrong thing
- random ] appears at the end of line sometimes (part of an escape sequence?)

- 11/4
- editor starts on the second line and you can't scroll up 
- you can scroll up with mouse but then the first line prints repeatedly
- horizontal scroll doesn't work
- horizontal scroll kind of works, but tons of empty space at the end and going up doesn't snap back
- arrow up snaps to the end of the line instead of the char after it
- a bunch of tildes surf across the screen
- status line goes across multiple lines
